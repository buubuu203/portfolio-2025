        I’m a Product Owner with experience working on data-aware, system-driven
        platforms, where product decisions are shaped by metrics, operational
        realities, and technical constraints.
        <br />I enjoy clarifying ambiguous problems, defining end-to-end
        workflows, and working closely with engineers to turn complex logic into
        structured, scalable product solutions. <br />
        My background includes consumer-facing products with high traffic as
        well as internal tools and admin systems that support operations at
        scale — from promotions and payments to on-site execution and
        monitoring. <br />
        I’m particularly interested in roles where product impact is measurable,
        trade-offs are explicit, and collaboration between product, engineering,
        and business is essential.
